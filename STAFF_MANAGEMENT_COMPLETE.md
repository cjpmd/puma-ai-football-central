## **🔧 How to Use (For Chris McDonald):**

**Step 1: Link Chris McDonald as Staff**
1. Go to **Team Management** page
2. Click **"Manage Staff Links"** button on the relevant team card  
3. Search for "Chris McDonald" in the user search box
4. Click **"Link"** next to his name to connect him as a staff member

**Step 2: Assign Staff to Events** 
1. Go to **Calendar Events** and open any event
2. Click **"Team Selection"** to manage squads
3. Use the new **"Staff" tab** (next to Squad and Formation)
4. Select Chris McDonald from the staff list - this creates his availability record automatically

**Step 3: Manage Availability**
1. Chris McDonald will now see **dual-role availability controls** in the calendar
2. He can set availability as both **Parent** (for Andrew) and **Staff** (for coaching duties)
3. The system shows both roles stacked vertically: "Parent: ✓ Available | Staff: ⏰ Pending"

## **🎯 Key Benefits:**

- **Zero design disruption** - Uses existing UI patterns and components
- **Automatic role detection** - Shows parent + staff options when applicable  
- **Real-time status tracking** - Immediate visibility of staff availability
- **Scalable system** - Works for multiple roles and complex team structures
- **Complete audit trail** - All availability changes are tracked per role

The system now handles the exact scenario you described - parents who also serve as staff can manage availability for both roles seamlessly within your existing beautiful interface! 🚀
